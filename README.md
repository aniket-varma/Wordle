# Wordle

  - Your challenge is to guess a five-letter word in six attempts. 
  - Each time you guess, you're told which of your chosen letters are in the target word, and whether they are in the right place.
  - The goal is to guess a mystery five-letter word in as few tries as possible. 
  - After each guess, the color of the tiles will change to show how close your guess was to the word.
